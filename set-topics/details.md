**DETAILS** AND RESOLUTION
1. increase sim resolution, under: *NinjaLive Actor /NinjaLiveComponent /LivePerformance /Resolution*
2. make sure your sim X/Y resolution ratio MATCHES the sim are scale (eg.: tracemesh is 20 x 40, sim res is 1024 x 2048)
This vid snippet explains how to scale sim components: https://youtu.be/vXalfRAnXak?t=1884
3. By default, overlapping objects are projected onto the simulation plane using rays from the camera. This results glitches from low angles.
This video explains how to set up a custom ray source to avoid low-angle glitches: https://youtu.be/2QlJ2f0aK5E
4. In case you'd like to enrich the sim output: use detail maps - explained here: https://youtu.be/vXalfRAnXak?t=4529
