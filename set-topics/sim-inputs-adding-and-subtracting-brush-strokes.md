Ninja simulation could be driven with two kind of inputs: "FIELD" OR "BRUSH".
(1) Fields could be defined by (A) Textures (managed on the Preset Manager panel) or (B) Materials (managed at the Actor Details panel /NinjaLiveComponent /LiveGeneric) or (C) SceneCapture Camera / Streaming video input (managed at same place as input materials).
(See Level3, showcasing simulation density inputs)
(2) Brush: any spatial data that could be tracked as a 3D point - and this moving point could be projected to the 2D simulation plane, leaving strokes --- typically the pivot of animated objects + bones / sockets of skeletal meshes
(3) "Fields" could be "positive only" (can behave only additively), while "Brush strokes" could be additive OR subtractive --- depending on the state of the "Invert" flag, located at the Preset Manager panel / Brush section.
(4) So, we could add a texture, and subtract the brush from it -- see Level2A/Stage 11, Level 23/Stage 4 and many more places
