🖐️ --- Let us break this ⬆️ down into smaller features!
LIVE-2 comes with support for the below listed features:
.
1. Large World Coordinates (LWC), so simulation and setup elements work beyond the UE standard 20x20 kilometers base tile
2. World Partitioning for Landscapes, so we can handle Landscape Components streamed in runtime (and spline rivers could intersect with the landscape!)
3. Spline based rivers: Spline-Mesh generator with no spatial limits, and Core simulation to handle the splines, like this: https://youtu.be/QuCO66Tv8zw?t=291
4. Spline based rivers could connect to "big flats" (lake, sea), with limitations (limitation: the lake is feature-less, just a big flat water surface)
5. Waterfalls are SEPARATE simulation actors that could be placed and set up MANUALLY - like this: https://youtu.be/QuCO66Tv8zw?t=315

Suggestion: check the technology described under points 3-5 by playing with the playable test-build! ➡️ [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/850913821240983553/1475901717529755738/1479439429264347218)
